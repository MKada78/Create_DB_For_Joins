# Create_DB_For_Joins
DB to train with joins and other SQL requests.
Create a MySQL DB to experiment basics concepts such as:
- create/drop PK and FK
- run SQL requests
- use all types of joins
...

## Files in my repository:
- schema.sql = the schema file for my DB structure
- data.sql = the data file for my DB data loading and table manipulations
- Enoncé2_SQL.docx = questions and answers to go throught the exercices

### Prerequisites
- MySQL or any other compatible RDBMS
- A text editor such as Sublime Text or Notepad++

### To re-created the testdb DB:
Download the schema and data files then run the following command from within your MySQL console:
SOURCE C:<path to your schema.sql>/<your_schema.sql_file>
SOURCE C:<path to your data.sql>/<your_data.sql_file>

Then go through the exercices contained within the file "Enoncé2_SQL.docx".
